To change client configuration go to _Client/Config.cs_, then save and build client using dotnet or Visual Studio.

To disable Console UI in Client go to _Client/client.csproj_ and replace `<OutputType>exe</OutputType>` to `<OutputType>winexe</OutputType>` (Works only for Windows!)

Sorry, but I'm so lazy to make client build feature in application, maybe in future updates? :P
